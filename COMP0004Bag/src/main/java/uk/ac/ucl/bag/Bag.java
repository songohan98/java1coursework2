/**
 * A Bag is a data structure that can hold a collection of values (really object references of course), along with
 * a count of how many copies of the value are in the collection.
 *
 * Each unique value is actually stored only once (i.e., there is only one object representing the value in the
 * data structure at any one time), along with a count of how many additional copies of the same
 * value have been added. The count is decremented when a value is removed. Values with a count of zero are no
 * longer stored.
 *
 * Bag extends the Iterable interface from the standard Java Class Library, meaning that a bag object provides an
 * iterator returning each value in the Bag in turn.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the objects (values) stored in the Bag. The object must be an instance of a class that
 * implements the Comparable interface from the standard Java Class Library. This is what the syntax
 * <T extends Comparable> means, constraining the valid instantiations of T to a type that conforms to Comparable.
 * As a bag implementation requires object values to be compared, an object stored in a bag must support the
 * compareTo method defined by the Comparable interface.
